ouliprogram
===========

Right now this is the raw code that powered the Oulipost scripts page for the Found Poetry Review's Oulipost project, National Poetry Month 2014. Soon, it will be part of a project called "AppliedPoetics" that will be a computational poetics journalish monster. 

There's an experiment up at www.appliedpoetics.org.

The code's messy. It works. Kinda.
