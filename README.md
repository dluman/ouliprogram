ouliprogram
===========

Right now this is the raw code that powered the Oulipost scripts page for the Found Poetry Review's Oulipost project, National Poetry Month 2014. Someday, it will be part of a project called "AppliedPoetics" that will be a computational poetics journalish monster.

There have been a few additions (I dare not call them "improvements") that have been made to the code over the past year. Here's a list of what the code can do (descriptions of these forthcoming, but you can find them listed across the internet as "Oulipean" constraints, thoughs some were created by request of specific users):

"Oulipean"
* Tautogram
* Lipogram
* Prisoner's Constraint
* Homoconsonantisms
* Fibonacci Sequence constraints
* "Beau Presente"/"Beautiful Inlaw"
* Univocalism

Custom/Not strictly "Oulipean"
* Quotes Only
* Questions Only
* "Nth word" selector
* Part of Speech restrictor (the python script included herein is the functionality that drives this)
* Word before/after selector

Each of these is implemented at: http://www.douglasjluman.com/scripts-tools/

The code's messy. It works. Kinda.
